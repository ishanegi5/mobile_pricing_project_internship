# Mobile Price Range Prediction (Random Forest Classifier)

## 📌 Overview
Beginner-level ML project done during early internship-style training.  
This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict mobile phone price categories (low, medium, high, very high) based on hardware specifications.

It was completed with full support using learning resources and ChatGPT assistance — not an independent project, but part of my learning foundation.

## 🧠 Objective
Classify mobile phones into different price ranges using supervised learning techniques.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 📊 Algorithm Used
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
Used for multi-class classification of phones based on features like battery, RAM, screen size, camera, etc.

## 📈 Evaluation
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report  
- Heatmap Visualization of Predictions

## 🧪 Sample Prediction
The code includes a sample input example to predict price range using the trained model.

## 📝 Notes
This was a guided project completed during a beginner internship period.  
It helped me understand ML pipelines, preprocessing, and model evaluation steps.
## 📂 Dataset
- [mobile_price_data.csv](./mobile_price_data.csv) — included in this repo for reproducibility

## 🚀 Status
✅ Completed as a learning milestone  
🔜 Will revisit in future for cleaner structure and documentation
